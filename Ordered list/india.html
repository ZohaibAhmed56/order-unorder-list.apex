    India Gate is a war memorial located in New Delhi, India. Built in 1921, it commemorates the 70,000 Indian soldiers who died in World War I and the Third Anglo-Afghan War. Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, the gate is a 138-foot-tall (42 meters) archway made of red sandstone and granite. At night, the gate is beautifully illuminated, making it a popular tourist attraction and a symbol of India's rich history and culture.</p>
